### Issues during development and testing
- There was an attempt to use Protractor as the e2e tool; however, there was an issue with Chromedriver being the wrong version despite downloading the right version from the internet. Furthermore, Protractor reached end-of-life in August 2023 and it is discouraged for new users to adopt Protractor. An alternative, Cypress, was found. Cypress was chosen due to its ease of use and modernity. Furthermore, there were some articles recommending Cypress after Protractor had reached end-of-life.
